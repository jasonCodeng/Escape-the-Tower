# Escape-the-Tower

This is my final project for my Game Programming course at Hunter College. It was developed in Unity3D with the scripts written in JavaScript or C#. It is a 3rd person survival game.

The purpose of the game is to escape a tower, hence the name. The player is first spawned in a hallway and will go through a sequence of rooms that serve as a tutorial. After the rooms, the player will enter the main game area, the tower. The tower is linear and has no floors. There are blocks that will fall periodically and will crush the player if landed on. The player must jump on the blocks and reach the top of the tower.
